Customer Support Ticket Auto-Triage ðŸ¤–

This project implements an advanced machine learning solution focused on revolutionizing customer support through intelligent ticket classification and automated routing systems.

The core mission is to 

enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction by automating the initial processing of support tickets, thereby reducing manual effort and accelerating resolution times.

1. Project Objective and Goal
The primary goal is to 

develop and deploy a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying customer support tickets into predefined categories and routing them to the most appropriate team or agent.

Key Ticket Categories
The model performs multi-class classification across the following categories:


Bug Report: Reporting software defects or errors for immediate action.


Feature Request: Gathering user suggestions for new functionalities and enhancements.


Technical Issue: Addressing problems requiring specialized technical assistance and troubleshooting.


Billing Inquiry: Handling questions and discrepancies related to invoices, payments, and subscriptions.


Account Management: Resolving issues regarding user accounts, profiles, and access controls.

2. Project Deliverables
This repository contains all necessary components to fulfill the project requirements:


Trained ML Model: A fully trained and optimized classification model, ready for production.


API Endpoint: Code for a robust RESTful API (likely using Flask or FastAPI) for real-time ticket classification and integration.


Technical Documentation: A comprehensive report (e.g., in a /docs folder) on the methodology, results, and usage guidelines.

3. Setup and Installation
3.1. Technical Requirements
The project requires the following environment and libraries:


Python: Version 3.8+.


Key Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, NLTK/SpaCy, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.


Version Control: Git (mandatory for collaboration).
